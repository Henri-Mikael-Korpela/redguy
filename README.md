# RedGuy - A basic Commodore 64 game test

I decided to try to program in C64 assembly at some point in 2022 and here is the result.

You can move around using a red figure called RedGuy. If you press a joystick button, you can perform an epilectic background color change.

You cannot win the game. You just move around.

Just for fun. At least I could accomplish the goal of making something move around on the screen.
